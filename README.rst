prob_Budyko_tx (probabilistic Budyko)
==================================

The main goal of this work was to evaluate the vulnerability of water availability due to climate change using the
probabilistic Budyko under a bottom-up approach. It follows the ideas of two main research papers: to validate actual
evapotranspiration products (`Weerasinghe et al. 2019 <https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/hess-2019-233/>`__) and to apply the probabilistic Budyko (`Singh and Kumar 2015 <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL066363>`__).
